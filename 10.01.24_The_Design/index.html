            <p>
              Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I
              could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I
              wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had
              only on paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for
              some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I
              thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a
              daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was
              that the result was just something nice and did not solve any
              problem.

            <h3>Start with asking why</h3>
            <p>
              You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more
              effective ways of achieving goals.

              By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas
              will be fresher and more valuable.

            <h3>Design solutions with love</h3>
            <p>
              Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the
              frustration of the users and resolve to end it.

            <h3>Share and show your work</h3>
            <p>
              As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not
              finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept
              feedback and learn from it.

          <h5>Are you ready? Let's go!!</h5>
          <p>
            The challenge lasts 30 days. On each of those days you will have to
            create a solution to any problem you yourself are facing and show
            the result to the community.
